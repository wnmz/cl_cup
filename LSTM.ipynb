Some founders go back to school and keep working on the startup while there.  However, those do so much worse than the people who work on the startup full-time that going back to school seems, in practice, not too far removed from a death sentence for a startup.Off the top of my head, I\\'d guess we\\'ve had about 8 startups where the founders went back to school.  It doesn\\'t only happen with summer batches.  Founders from winter batches do it too.Usually the reason is that the startup isn\\'t doing very well. However, that judgement depends a lot on how determined the founders are.  One reason we now shy away from funding people still in school is that they often unconsciously want the startup to fail, because the idea of dropping out frightens them.A lot of startups look bad after 3 months.

(leading to statements that, out of his twisted context, are totally bewildering like \"its capabilities are complex\".)\\nHis argument about simplicity and complexity not being mutually exclusive is a matter of definition, and thus he undermines others by foisting his definition into their mouths and then screaming bloody murder when he deduces that changing the premises of someone\\'s argument does indeed damage its conclusions.\\nAmong other things I think his comparison of stats between Mongrel and Fogbugz is fundamentally broken. Mongrel is among other things free. Beyond the intense need to brag about his project\\'s success I can\\'t see any legitimate reason for making that particular comparison.\\n(Beyond this point I rant about his usage of Hangul for his example, feel free to skip rest of post.)\\nHis comprehension of the Korean writing system, which is one of his \"powerful\" points, seems superficial at best. Hangul is a language that was designed by a small group of advisors when the royalty realized most koreans were illiterate (not enough resources to spend learning chinese kanji). How the hell are we supposed to be surprised that something explicitly designed to be simple, in fact, turned out to be simple? Some extra points can be deducted for the fact that they stopped using hangul for several hundred years until it was institutionalized by the strong nationalist movement post WWII and made the official writing system in an effort to establish a unique Korean culture. Additionally we can pause curiously while noting that the average Korean still uses 700-800 Chinese kanji in daily life, and that academic papers still use the kanji for particularly esoteric or complex concepts (although this is increasingly discouraged as it is viewed as elitism). He crucifies Joel and Don for using limited examples to justify a point... and then use a single example to prove his, along with unsubstantiated claims about linguistic researchers. The Japanese katakana alphabet can represent many words very well... until you try to do one with an L in it, and then it fails utterly. Using one contrived example wouldn\\'t reveal that, and its the same reason I doubt his point about hangul.\\nBeyond technicalities, its ignorant to conflate the creation of one small group of individuals six hundred years ago with the cultural preferences of modern Korea.

When you use the tighter loop, the compiler turns everything (roughly) into this:Iterator it=list.iterator(); //Which calls new ListItr();\\nfor (it.hasNext())\\n{\\nObject next=it.next();The abstraction has to do that because it doesn't know whether the list (really, the java.util.Collection) is a LinkedList or an ArrayList or a Set. If your loop itself is in a tight loop, it isn't hard to call it millions and millions of times during program execution--which makes millions and millions of unnecessary allocations and method calls.

There were also a lot of guys who spent 75 hours a week in meetings and farting around on the internet, and 5 hours doing useful work. I've been both of those guys at different startups. The myth comes from back in the days when there was a lot of code to be written. Certain projects, like games, have TONS of code. Even the sharpest programmer can only type so fast, and even the fastest compiler can only compile so fast. The only way for projects like that to come to fruition in any reasonable amount of time is for people to work long hours.The nature of software startups has changed. With web apps, the code base is relatively small and simple. There usually isn't a compile cycle. What happens now, is you spend all your time on systems administration issues. Shit breaks, you need to respond to it immediately. I sort of miss the days where programming 70 hours a week was an option.

I joined a startup straight out of college as employee #13 (at the time, it had about 8 employees in the office at any given time).  It was profitable, I liked the people, and they were doing some pretty cool stuff.Overall, I would do it over again but probably will not remain with them for much longer, if that makes any sense.   Some observations:The language choice will grate on you after a while.  I dunno what the background of posters saying \"Be professional.  Suck it up.\" is, but I actually liked Java coding when I started, and have since learned to hate it.  If you\\'re going in with a strong aversion to Java &#38; C++ already, it\\'ll probably only get worse.Flip side is that you do get better at these languages after you work with them a while, as long as you keep an open mind.  There are tricks and tools in C++ to help you manage memory - you shouldn\\'t be tracing pointers from new to delete.  And Java\\'s verbosity isn\\'t as bad once you get used it and consider \"for(int i = 0; i &#60; array.length; ++i)....\" to be a single map function that just has a really long name. ;-)One question to ask that\\'ll help you determine if the language will end up becoming a total drag: are they using it because the problem fits the language\\'s strengths, or are they using it because they don\\'t know any better and aren\\'t comfortable with multi-language solutions?  Every mainstream language is good for something.  In my case, I was perfectly happy as long as I was writing IDE plugins and server software in Java, and then became very unhappy once I had to write a webapp.  (IMNSHO, Java is irredeemably broken for webapps; the only sane way to do them is to strip out all the JavaEE bullshit and program on bare servlets, but then you get something that\\'s nowhere near as nice as Python/PHP/Perl.)There are plenty of things beyond programming that you learn from working in a successful (profitable) startup.  OTOH, it\\'s not rocket science.  Basically, you can boil it all down to: 1.) Make something people want, 2.) Charge more for it than it costs you, and 3.) Fix problems now rather than later.  Every failed startup I\\'ve been involved with has neglected at least one of these: every successful startup has done all three.I dunno what you expect financially out of this, but be aware that founders get rich, late-stage employees get paid, and early-stage employees get screwed.  At least in proportion to the amount of effort they put in.  One startup I worked in went bust, taking my 0.1% of stock options with it.  One that I interviewed at offered me about 0.01% of the company; I did the math, and calculated that at their expected $40M exit, I would get a whole $4000.  I have no equity at my current employer.  My cubemate was an early employee at CCBN, which was sold to Thomson for about $40M.  He got $3K or so.  I have another friend who was employee #35 at Stratus and later a VP; she was rich for a while when they ended up with a billion-$ market cap, but ended up poor again after the stock crashed.  If you plan on being an early employee at a startup, you should do it for learning or for the experience rather than any perceived financial rewards.\\n\\x08', 'Is it bad if I don\\'t want to work at a C++/Java startup?If you think you\\'ll be unhappy doing the actual work that you\\'ll be doing when you take the job, the job isn\\'t worth it.  There\\'s no difference between being employee #9 or being employee #99999 in that regard.Also, if they\\'re successful enough with their current languages, you will not change them.  Taking a job saying \"I know they use X, but I\\'ll talk them into using Y instead, and then I\\'ll be happy!\" is like entering a relationship saying \"I know she does X that drives me nuts, but I know if I pester her enough, she\\'ll stop it, and then I\\'ll be happy!\"  Doesn\\'t work that way.\\n\\x08', 'Is it bad if I don\\'t want to work at a C++/Java startup?I\\'ve noticed there is a negative bias towards the \"enterprise\" languages by many on this forum. Not calling out gregwebs in particular, just speaking generally. I think much of the negativism stems from the hacker mentality that big companies are evil and that breaking the rules is cool. Therefore anything that big companies do or use is automatically uncool.Nothing wrong with this mindset, but I think it often goes too far with some. Java and C++ are not bad languages. Yes, most large software companies use them but there are some reasons why they might be a desirable choice. One is that these languages work well in a collaborative work environment. There are many proven debugging tools, established QA practices, very good IDEs with integrated revision synchronization tools, etc. While these may not matter for the hacker or small group of hackers creating something cool, they are very important considerations for a growing software company who has plans to scale.So with this understanding in mind I wouldn\\'t automatically rule out a company based on the fact they code in C++/Java.

Candidates are told to do the interview where they can receive email.  To avoid cheating, we send them a couple of code snippets right as we call them. Then, we talk about the code.We found that phone screeners have a bias toward those who speak well, so we often brought in terrible programmers for a half day of interviews. What a waste, especially when flying people in.  The in-person failures we experienced were of the FizzBuzz variety, not the \"I don\\'t exactly under stand concurrency\" sort.So, we started asking people to read some code and comment on it.  Really basic Java stuff: Will this code compile?  Trace the flow of execution through this method if the BlahException was thrown.  String comparisons with ==.  The idea was to see if (1) the person was at all clueful, and (2) if they had actually written Java code.  As the linked blogger noted, the disparity in responses is shocking. We found that about half the people we interviewed thought that execution of a Java method ceased once a catch block had been entered.  Half!  How could they ever have written robust production code?  These were often people with years of Java experience on their resumes.  I just don\\'t understand how someone could write a bunch of Java code and not understand the basics of how exceptions work.Some other parts of the code review were more nuanced.  Most candidates knew that one should not compare strings using double equals, but they usually couldn\\'t explain why.  Nor did they understand why == sometimes seems to work when comparing a referenced String object to a literal. We were happy to hire smart candidates that hadn\\'t done a lot of Java work, but we wanted to avoid people who had supposedly spent years with a language and didn\\'t even comprehend the basics. \\n\\x08', \"Code Critique as an Interview ToolI think this depends on what you are looking for in a candidate.  Being able to read code is good, but if you want to hire someone who is really good now and will be 10x better in 6-12 months, you don't want someone who is opinionated and arrogant about what constitutes good code.

Paul ignores two critical issues: Risk, and non-linear utility-of-money functions.  These two factors become critical when there is a tradeoff between probability of success and the payoff of success.Suppose, as a simple example, that I have a startup which I think has a 50% chance of succeeding and being sold for $1M, and a 50% chance of failing and being worthless.  Now suppose that Paul selects me to participate in YC, but wants 10% of the company, and I think his help will leave the potential valuation unchanged but increase the chance of success from 50% to 55%.  If I accept his offer, my EXPECTED return drops from $500k (50% of $1M) to $495k (55% of $900k) -- but I'd still accept the offer, because increasing my chance of getting that first $900k is worth far more than getting an additional $100k on top of that.On the other hand, suppose a venture capital company comes along and offers to help me expand into a much larger market, where I'd have a 10% chance of the company being worth $100M (and a 90% chance of the company being worthless), in exchange for taking 50% of the company stock.  If I accept the offer, my EXPECTED return jumps from $500k to $5M (10% of $50M) -- but there's no way that I'd accept the offer, because I really don't want to spend years of my life on something which has a 90% chance of being worthless.It's important to understand the numbers, but in the end the numbers, at best, have to guide you rather than making decisions for you.\\n\\x08\", \"The Equity EquationPaul - This is Seth Levine (quoted in the USA Today article referenced and appropriately called out in your post).

Another alternative is to split the equity 50/50, but have the voting rights divided differently.

Lighttpd can do a few things: it does fast cgi (fcgi support explains about 75% of the examples in that list), it can serve static files, and it can proxy requests to other servers. Lighttpd doesn\\'t \"support Mongrel\", because Mongrel is another server. What Lighttpd does is use something akin to mod_proxy to send certain requests somewhere else, that somewhere else might be a Mongrel cluster that is running on port 8080 (hence it \"supports\" Mongrel).\\nThat proxying service is where the majority of Lighttpd usage has been. A typical efficient setup these days (YouTube does along these lines) is to have lighttpd accept incoming requests and if the request is for a static file then it serves the request (because it is very lightweight (i.e. minimal) it is more efficient than Apache at serving static media), and if it is for dynamic content the request is passed to Apache, which then passes it back to Lighttpd, which passes it back to the requester (this means that \"heavy\" Apache threads will be dedicated to a request for a shorter period of time since it only has to communicate/wait for Lighttpd instead of the actual requester).\\nLighttpd on its own isn\\'t necessarily the best solution (an example from my experience is that mod_python and Apache become more efficient at serving dynamic content than fcgi and Lighttpd as the numbers of requester per second get very high). Usually a combination of a light frontend server and Apache in the backend can provide the best performance (again this is at high numbers, at lower numbers lighttpd is probablly equally or more efficient).\\nAs a final note, I\\'d really recommend Nginx over Lighttpd if you are looking for a light http server to serve static content, support fcgi, and/or proxy to other servers. The biggest reason? Lighttpd leaks memory and has to be restarted occasionally because every couple of days (under heavy usage) it dies. Not a great feature in a production server.\\n\\x08', \"The rise of lighttpd (excellent web server)The big win of lighttpd/nginx is that they're single-process [1] multiplexing servers.

So, keep that in mind when reading my comments below.This is an idea I've heard before. I agree that everything in the world is going to the web. File systems will become distributed. Every application you use will come from the internet, with the exception of your kernel and the software needed to retrieve the applications. They'll probably run remotely, too, and just send you the graphics/UI.However, I think that turning the web browser into a window manager is going in the wrong direction. It completely disobeys the Unix philosophy of writing programs that do one thing well. Firefox's role in the future should be rendering and running remote applications. Organizing the apps using tabs, MDI, windows, workspaces, viewports, etc. should be left to the people who are spending all of their time thinking about how to organize applications.\\n\\x08\", 'Anyone have thoughts on the viability of a firefox os?I think when you say \"firefox os\" you really mean \"browser-based UI for Linux,\" right? You are already supposing that Linux (an actual operating system) exists underneath.Isn\\'t Internet Explorer + Windows Explorer + Web Folders pretty much doing this already? Windows\\' Web Folders feature lets you store documents remotely and access them over HTTP from regular (non-web-enabled) applications. Internet Explorer lets you browse the local filesystem and the web from the same browser window pretty seamlessly.It seems that Firefox is indeed becoming an application deployment platform. However, it doesn\\'t seem like a good idea to me. Instead of having one package manager in the operating system, there will be two: one system package manage and one Firefox package manager. There are all kinds of security and manageability problems with that. Already, there are many buggy Firefox plugins that cripple the browser, effectively causing a DOS attack with crashes and decreased performance. This is a good indication that we should not have confidence in Firefox\\'s abilities to manage third party applications. Really Firefox should be in that business at all, since resource allocation and crash prevention are fundamentally operating system features. The right solution is to improve the installation experience provided by the operating system, and have it provide security-oriented integration capabilities for applications (as opposed to to the performance-oriented integration capabilities we have now). This would require the operating system to provide a sandboxed environment by default to downloaded applications. The OS needs to provide a middle ground between the almost unrestricted access given to today\\'s downloaded applications, and the totally restricted access given to web apps; that access needs to be very close to the web app side.With this kind of severely-limited sandbox, we can then eliminate the whole UI of application installation. Instead of installation, we would just have caching. Instead of a list of programs in \"Add/Remove Programs,\" we would just have a \"Free up XXX MB of disk space\" page.\\n\\x08', \"Anyone have thoughts on the viability of a firefox os?Yes, this is a great idea. I don't use much more than a web browser, though Firefox 2.0 really gets bogged down with complex Flash and Javascript. The rendering engine of Firefox 3.0 is much better in that sense.I've thought about this in great detail. The essential point is that a pure Firefox GUI allows someone uncomfortable with a normal computer to accomplish amazing tasks. Limiting the user interface allows them to accomplish more and there's almost nothing that can't be done from Firefox anyways.

Photoflock.com for example relies purely on client persistence to manage the user's upload history. It's a simpler solution than requiring accounts -- there's less friction for a user to begin interacting with your site (ie no registration process) -- but doing things like tracking accounts and providing reliable usage stats is pretty difficult.Additionally, your users will never be able to (easily) sych between computers and to be honest you'll eventually add user accounts anyway. That's not to say that you'll implement a full username/password scheme, but you will need some sort of server-side persistence.That's where I'm at in my development right now, and I'm looking at a happy middle ground where the user CAN have an account (optionally) to do things like sync between computers but will vary rarely be asked for account information.

Giving them incentive to come back to your site. I always thought that user registration adds friction to any app. I guess it all comes down to how it's implemented and how easy it is to get user from point A to B on your app.(e.g. reddit's way of user registration comes mind) Although the implementation of OpenID should ease that restriction a bit.
